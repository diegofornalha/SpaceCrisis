# TGS - The Game Services Kit

![Head Image](https://i.imgur.com/EZgBMqYh.png)

TGS is a universal framework that provides game data services on the blockchain. It allows game developers to focus more on game development itself rather than spending a lot of time learning the complex use of smart contracts. Additionally, its social login priority and walletless login process also enable blockchain games to support quick trial experiences that are applicable to traditional games, with wallet integration placed later in the experience flow. Its environment state synchronization feature can also keep the on-chain and off-chain data of the game in sync with logical consistency.

Space Crisis is a demo game that uses TGS services. It is a traditional flight shooting game that can read NFTs from the wallet as unlock conditions for equipment.

In subsequent iterations, we will simultaneously iterate TGS and Space Crisis, expanding them into more complete products.

## Key Features

### Walletless Onboarding

TGS supports a walletless onboarding process, allowing users to try games without the need for a wallet. This is made possible through social login, where users can log in using their social media accounts, making the onboarding process more familiar and easy to use. By removing the barrier of needing a wallet to start playing, TGS makes blockchain gaming more accessible to casual gamers.

### Data Synchronization

TGS provides environment state synchronization functionality, which enables game developers to keep the on-chain and off-chain data of their game in sync with logical consistency. This ensures that players can enjoy a seamless gaming experience while also ensuring the integrity of the game's data.

### Easy Integration

TGS has a simple and easy-to-use API that game developers can use to integrate their game with TGS. This allows game developers to focus more on the development of their game, rather than spending a lot of time learning how to use blockchain technology.
